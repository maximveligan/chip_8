## Summary
This is a Chip 8 emulator written in rust using piston for input and graphics.

## Why Chip 8?
Chip 8 is a very simple system and is a good entrypoint to learning about emulator design.

### Purpose
I wrote this emulator to learn more about underlying CPU architecture and to learn more about how one would go about designing and writing an emulator.
